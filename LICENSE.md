Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

######1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

######2. Don't copy the Software and give it a new name.

######3. Don't sell the Software without contributing to it.

######4. If you contribute significantly and profit from selling the software, split the profit with other contributors fairly. If I write 90% of the code, you write 10%, and you sell the game for $100, give me $90. Profit includes advertisement revenue as well as sales profit.  Don't worry about giving money to people under a certain percentage (this percentage can be decided at the time of the release). If someone wrote comments until 1% of the code was theirs, don't give them $1 out of the $100. They didn't make a significant contribution by implementing a new feature, improving an existing feature, or eliminating any significant errors or other problems.

######4a. Don't cake the Software up with intrusive advertisements and give it a bad reputation. You make money by releasing a great product and having good customer relations, not by tricking a kid into clicking the pop-up ad instead of the "play" button.

######5. Don't modify the Software to contain any hidden harmful content.
